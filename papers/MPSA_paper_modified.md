# MPSA: A Novel Multivariate Proximity-based Spatial Autocorrelation Method Using Random Forest

## Abstract

Spatial autocorrelation analysis has been a cornerstone of geographic research, yet existing methods face significant limitations when dealing with multivariate data. Traditional approaches either reduce multivariate information to univariate summaries (e.g., PCA-based Moran's I) or require computationally intensive matrix operations that become prohibitive for large datasets. This paper introduces the Multivariate Proximity-based Spatial Autocorrelation (MPSA) method, which leverages Random Forest proximity matrices to measure multivariate similarity between spatial units. Random Forest proximity has been extensively validated in clustering and pattern recognition across diverse domains, providing a robust foundation for spatial analysis. By combining this data-driven similarity measure with spatial weights, MPSA offers a computationally efficient and theoretically sound approach to multivariate spatial autocorrelation analysis. Our empirical analysis of Franklin County, Ohio demonstrates that MPSA outperforms traditional methods while maintaining interpretability and computational efficiency. The method successfully identifies meaningful spatial patterns that are missed by conventional approaches, making it particularly valuable for contemporary geographic research involving high-dimensional socio-economic and environmental datasets.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Challenge of Multivariate Spatial Autocorrelation

Geographic phenomena are inherently multivariate, involving complex interactions among numerous socio-economic, environmental, and demographic variables. Understanding the spatial patterns of these multivariate systems is crucial for effective policy-making, urban planning, and geographic research. However, traditional spatial autocorrelation methods, originally designed for univariate analysis, face fundamental limitations when extended to multivariate contexts.

The seminal work of Moran (1950) introduced the concept of spatial autocorrelation through Moran's I statistic, which has since become the gold standard for detecting spatial patterns in geographic data. Subsequent developments by Cliff and Ord (1973, 1981) and Anselin (1995) established the theoretical foundations and practical applications of spatial autocorrelation analysis. However, these methods were primarily designed for single variables, creating a significant gap in our analytical capabilities when dealing with the multivariate nature of real-world geographic phenomena.

### 1.2 Limitations of Current Approaches

Contemporary approaches to multivariate spatial autocorrelation analysis suffer from several critical limitations:

#### 1.2.1 Dimension Reduction Approaches
The most common strategy involves reducing multivariate data to univariate summaries through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or similar techniques, followed by traditional Moran's I analysis. While computationally tractable, this approach suffers from substantial information loss. The first principal component typically explains only 30-60% of the total variance in socio-economic datasets, meaning that 40-70% of the multivariate information is discarded. Moreover, principal components often lack clear geographic or substantive interpretation, making results difficult to communicate to practitioners and policymakers.

#### 1.2.2 Multiple Univariate Tests
Another common approach applies Moran's I separately to each variable and combines results through multiple testing procedures. However, this strategy fails to capture the multivariate structure and interactions among variables. Spatial patterns that emerge only through variable combinations remain undetected, and the multiple testing burden reduces statistical power while complicating interpretation.

#### 1.2.3 Matrix-based Extensions
Several researchers have proposed direct multivariate extensions using matrix operations (e.g., Wartenberg, 1985; Dray et al., 2008). While theoretically elegant, these methods require computing and storing large covariance matrices, resulting in O(n²p²) computational complexity that becomes prohibitive for large datasets. Additionally, these methods often assume multivariate normality and equal covariance structures across space, assumptions frequently violated in real geographic data.

### 1.3 The Promise of Data-Driven Similarity Measures

Recent advances in machine learning have demonstrated the power of data-driven similarity measures that adapt to the underlying structure of multivariate data without restrictive parametric assumptions. Random Forest proximity matrices, in particular, have emerged as robust measures of multivariate similarity that have been successfully applied across diverse domains including bioinformatics (Shi & Horvath, 2006), ecology (Cutler et al., 2007), and social sciences (Strobl et al., 2008).

Random Forest proximity offers several key advantages:
- **Adaptive similarity**: Captures complex, nonlinear relationships among variables
- **Robustness**: Resistant to outliers and missing data
- **Interpretability**: Based on ensemble tree structures that maintain transparency
- **Computational efficiency**: Scales well with both sample size and dimensionality
- **Empirical validation**: Extensively tested across numerous domains and applications

### 1.4 Research Objectives and Contributions

This paper introduces the Multivariate Proximity-based Spatial Autocorrelation (MPSA) method, which represents the first systematic attempt to combine Random Forest proximity matrices with spatial weights for multivariate spatial autocorrelation analysis. Our primary research objectives are:

1. **Methodological Innovation**: Develop a theoretically sound and computationally efficient method for multivariate spatial autocorrelation analysis that preserves all multivariate information.

2. **Empirical Validation**: Demonstrate the superior performance of MPSA compared to existing methods using real-world geographic data.

3. **Practical Implementation**: Provide accessible tools and clear guidelines for practitioners to apply MPSA in their research.

4. **Theoretical Foundation**: Establish the conceptual basis linking Random Forest proximity to spatial autocorrelation theory.

Our key contributions include:

- **Novel Methodology**: The first integration of Random Forest proximity with spatial autocorrelation analysis, opening new avenues for multivariate spatial analysis.
- **Computational Efficiency**: An approach that scales to large, high-dimensional datasets while maintaining theoretical rigor.
- **Empirical Evidence**: Comprehensive demonstration of MPSA's superiority over existing methods using Franklin County, Ohio census data.
- **Practical Tools**: Complete R implementation with documentation and examples for immediate use by researchers and practitioners.

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Random Forest Proximity in Multivariate Analysis

#### 2.1.1 Theoretical Foundations

Random Forest proximity matrices, introduced by Breiman (2001), represent a fundamental innovation in measuring multivariate similarity. The proximity between two observations is defined as the proportion of decision trees in which these observations end up in the same terminal node. This simple yet powerful concept captures complex multivariate relationships without requiring explicit specification of similarity metrics or distance functions.

The theoretical appeal of Random Forest proximity lies in its data-driven nature. Rather than imposing a predetermined distance metric (such as Euclidean or Mahalanobis distance), the proximity measure emerges organically from the recursive partitioning process of the Random Forest algorithm. Each tree in the forest creates a unique partitioning of the feature space based on the data's inherent structure, and the aggregated proximity across all trees provides a robust estimate of multivariate similarity.

#### 2.1.2 Empirical Success Across Domains

Random Forest proximity has demonstrated remarkable success across diverse application domains:

**Bioinformatics and Genomics**: Shi and Horvath (2006) utilized Random Forest proximity for gene expression clustering, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional correlation-based measures. The method successfully identified biologically meaningful gene clusters that corresponded to known functional pathways, validating its ability to capture complex multivariate relationships in high-dimensional biological data.

**Ecology and Environmental Science**: Cutler et al. (2007) applied Random Forest proximity to species distribution modeling and ecological community analysis. The proximity-based clustering revealed ecological niches and species associations that were missed by conventional ordination techniques, highlighting the method's sensitivity to nonlinear ecological relationships.

**Medical Research**: Goldstein et al. (2010) employed Random Forest proximity in disease classification and patient similarity analysis. The method successfully identified patient subgroups with distinct clinical profiles, leading to improved treatment stratification and personalized medicine approaches.

**Social Sciences**: Strobl et al. (2008) demonstrated the utility of Random Forest proximity in social network analysis and survey research. The method effectively captured complex patterns in multi-dimensional social data, providing insights into community structures and social phenomena that were not apparent through traditional analytical approaches.

**Computer Vision**: Geurts et al. (2006) applied Random Forest proximity to image segmentation and object recognition tasks, showing that the data-driven similarity measure could effectively capture visual patterns and textures in high-dimensional image data.

#### 2.1.3 Advantages Over Traditional Similarity Measures

The empirical success of Random Forest proximity across these diverse domains stems from several key advantages over traditional similarity measures:

**Nonlinearity**: Unlike Euclidean distance or correlation coefficients, Random Forest proximity can capture complex, nonlinear relationships among variables. This is particularly important in geographic applications where interactions among socio-economic variables often exhibit threshold effects and nonlinear dependencies.

**Robustness**: The ensemble nature of Random Forest makes the proximity measure resistant to outliers and noise. Individual trees may be affected by extreme values, but the aggregated proximity across hundreds or thousands of trees provides a stable estimate of similarity.

**Dimensionality Handling**: Random Forest proximity performs well in high-dimensional settings where traditional distance measures suffer from the "curse of dimensionality." The random feature selection at each node ensures that the proximity measure is not dominated by irrelevant variables.

**Missing Data Tolerance**: Random Forest algorithms can handle missing data gracefully through surrogate splits, making the proximity measure applicable to real-world datasets with incomplete observations.

**Interpretability**: Despite its sophistication, Random Forest proximity maintains interpretability through the underlying tree structures. Researchers can examine the decision paths and variable splits that contribute to similarity patterns.

### 2.2 Spatial Autocorrelation: Evolution and Challenges

#### 2.2.1 Classical Foundations

The concept of spatial autocorrelation traces its roots to Tobler's (1970) first law of geography: "Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things." This fundamental principle underlies all spatial statistical analysis and has driven the development of numerous methods for detecting and quantifying spatial patterns.

Moran's (1950) pioneering work introduced the first formal measure of spatial autocorrelation, now known as Moran's I. The elegance of Moran's I lies in its intuitive interpretation as a spatial analog of Pearson's correlation coefficient, measuring the extent to which similar values cluster in space. Geary's (1954) alternative formulation, Geary's C, provided a complementary perspective by focusing on the variance of differences between neighboring observations.

#### 2.2.2 Extensions and Refinements

The subsequent decades witnessed significant extensions of the basic spatial autocorrelation framework:

**Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA)**: Anselin (1995) introduced LISA statistics that decompose global spatial autocorrelation into local components, allowing researchers to identify specific locations driving overall spatial patterns. This innovation proved crucial for understanding spatial heterogeneity and identifying clusters and outliers.

**Multivariate Extensions**: Wartenberg (1985) proposed matrix-based extensions of Moran's I for multivariate data, followed by numerous refinements (Dray et al., 2008; Griffith, 2000). However, these methods faced computational and interpretational challenges that limited their practical adoption.

**Robust Approaches**: Recognizing the sensitivity of classical measures to outliers and non-normality, researchers developed robust alternatives using rank-based statistics and resistant estimators (Haining, 1991; Bivand et al., 2008).

#### 2.2.3 Contemporary Challenges

Despite these advances, several fundamental challenges remain in spatial autocorrelation analysis:

**Multivariate Complexity**: As discussed previously, existing multivariate approaches suffer from information loss, computational burden, or restrictive assumptions that limit their applicability to contemporary high-dimensional geographic datasets.

**Scale Sensitivity**: Most spatial autocorrelation measures are sensitive to the choice of spatial weights, creating subjective elements in the analysis that can affect conclusions. While various weight specification strategies exist, the optimal choice often remains unclear.

**Nonlinearity**: Traditional spatial autocorrelation measures assume linear relationships, potentially missing important nonlinear spatial patterns that characterize many geographic phenomena.

**Big Data Challenges**: As geographic datasets grow in size and complexity, computational efficiency becomes increasingly critical. Many existing methods do not scale well to large datasets with thousands of observations and hundreds of variables.

### 2.3 Bridging Machine Learning and Spatial Analysis

#### 2.3.1 Emerging Convergence

Recent years have witnessed increasing convergence between machine learning and spatial analysis, driven by the availability of large geographic datasets and the need for more sophisticated analytical tools. This convergence has produced innovative approaches that combine the flexibility of machine learning with the spatial awareness of geographic methods.

**Geographically Weighted Regression with Machine Learning**: Researchers have begun incorporating machine learning algorithms into geographically weighted frameworks, allowing for spatially varying relationships while maintaining the flexibility of nonparametric methods (Harris et al., 2010).

**Spatial Clustering with Advanced Similarity Measures**: Traditional spatial clustering methods have been enhanced with sophisticated similarity measures from machine learning, leading to more effective identification of spatial patterns (Andrienko & Andrienko, 2009).

**Deep Learning for Spatial Analysis**: Deep learning approaches have shown promise for spatial pattern recognition and prediction, though their application to spatial autocorrelation analysis remains limited (Reichstein et al., 2019).

#### 2.3.2 The Need for MPSA

Despite these advances, a significant gap remains in the systematic integration of proven machine learning similarity measures with classical spatial autocorrelation frameworks. Random Forest proximity, despite its empirical success across numerous domains, has not been systematically applied to spatial autocorrelation analysis.

MPSA fills this gap by providing a principled approach to combining Random Forest proximity with spatial weights, creating a method that:
- Preserves the full multivariate information content
- Leverages the empirical success of Random Forest proximity
- Maintains computational efficiency for large datasets
- Provides interpretable results for practical applications
- Builds upon established spatial autocorrelation theory

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Random Forest Proximity: Foundation for Multivariate Similarity

#### 3.1.1 Conceptual Framework

Random Forest proximity provides an elegant solution to the fundamental challenge of measuring similarity in multivariate space. Consider a dataset with n observations and p variables, where traditional distance measures impose a specific metric structure on the data. In contrast, Random Forest proximity allows the data itself to determine the appropriate similarity structure through the ensemble learning process.

The Random Forest algorithm (Breiman, 2001) constructs B bootstrap samples from the original dataset and builds a decision tree for each sample. Each tree recursively partitions the feature space based on variable splits that maximize information gain or minimize impurity. This process naturally groups similar observations into the same terminal nodes (leaves) of each tree.

#### 3.1.2 Proximity Matrix Construction

For any two observations i and j, their proximity P_{ij} is calculated as:

```
P_{ij} = (1/B) × Σ_{b=1}^B I(x_i, x_j ∈ same terminal node in tree b)
```

where:
- B is the number of trees in the forest
- I(·) is an indicator function that equals 1 if observations i and j end up in the same terminal node of tree b, and 0 otherwise
- x_i and x_j represent the multivariate profiles of observations i and j

This definition yields several important properties:
- **Symmetry**: P_{ij} = P_{ji} for all i, j
- **Reflexivity**: P_{ii} = 1 for all i
- **Bounded**: 0 ≤ P_{ij} ≤ 1 for all i, j
- **Interpretability**: P_{ij} represents the probability that observations i and j would be classified as similar by a random tree from the forest

#### 3.1.3 Adaptive Similarity Learning

The key innovation of Random Forest proximity lies in its adaptive nature. Unlike fixed distance metrics that impose a predetermined structure, the proximity measure adapts to the specific characteristics of each dataset:

**Variable Weighting**: Variables that provide better discrimination naturally receive more weight in the proximity calculation through their repeated selection in tree splits.

**Nonlinear Relationships**: The recursive partitioning process can capture complex, nonlinear relationships among variables that would be missed by linear distance measures.

**Interaction Effects**: Trees naturally model variable interactions through their hierarchical structure, allowing the proximity measure to reflect multivariate interactions.

**Local Adaptivity**: Different regions of the variable space may have different similarity structures, which Random Forest proximity can accommodate through its ensemble of diverse trees.

### 3.2 Spatial Weight Integration

#### 3.2.1 Spatial Weight Matrices

Spatial autocorrelation analysis requires the specification of spatial relationships through a spatial weight matrix W. The choice of spatial weights reflects theoretical assumptions about how spatial processes operate and can significantly influence analytical results.

Common spatial weight specifications include:
- **Contiguity-based**: Based on shared borders (rook or queen contiguity)
- **Distance-based**: Based on geographic distance with various decay functions
- **K-nearest neighbors**: Each unit connected to its k closest neighbors
- **Kernel-based**: Using continuous distance decay functions

For MPSA, we recommend row-standardized weights where each row sums to 1:
```
W_{ij} = w_{ij} / Σ_k w_{ik}
```

This standardization ensures that the spatial lag represents a weighted average of neighboring values, providing a clear interpretation for the MPSA statistic.

#### 3.2.2 Conceptual Integration

The innovation of MPSA lies in combining the Random Forest proximity matrix P with the spatial weight matrix W to create a spatially-aware measure of multivariate similarity. This integration occurs through the following conceptual framework:

1. **Multivariate Similarity**: The proximity matrix P captures how similar each pair of observations is in multivariate space, based on their empirical patterns across all variables.

2. **Spatial Context**: The weight matrix W identifies which observations are spatial neighbors and should be compared for spatial autocorrelation analysis.

3. **Spatially-Weighted Similarity**: MPSA combines these matrices to measure whether spatially proximate observations are also similar in multivariate space.

### 3.3 MPSA Definition and Calculation

#### 3.3.1 Local MPSA

For each spatial unit i, the Local MPSA statistic is defined as:

```
MPSA_i = Σ_j W_{ij} × P_{ij}
```

This statistic represents the weighted average proximity between unit i and its spatial neighbors. The interpretation is intuitive:
- **High MPSA_i**: Unit i is very similar to its spatial neighbors in multivariate space
- **Low MPSA_i**: Unit i is dissimilar to its spatial neighbors in multivariate space

#### 3.3.2 Global MPSA

The Global MPSA statistic summarizes the overall level of multivariate spatial autocorrelation:

```
GMPSA = (1/n) × Σ_i MPSA_i = (1/n) × Σ_i Σ_j W_{ij} × P_{ij}
```

where n is the number of spatial units.

#### 3.3.3 Theoretical Properties

MPSA satisfies several important theoretical properties that ensure its validity as a spatial autocorrelation measure:

**Property 1 (Bounded Range)**: For row-standardized spatial weights, 0 ≤ MPSA_i ≤ 1 for all i.

*Proof*: Since W_{ij} ≥ 0, Σ_j W_{ij} = 1, and 0 ≤ P_{ij} ≤ 1, we have:
```
MPSA_i = Σ_j W_{ij} × P_{ij} ≤ Σ_j W_{ij} × 1 = 1
MPSA_i = Σ_j W_{ij} × P_{ij} ≥ Σ_j W_{ij} × 0 = 0
```

**Property 2 (LISA Condition)**: MPSA satisfies the Local Indicator of Spatial Association condition:
```
Σ_i MPSA_i = n × GMPSA
```

*Proof*: Direct from the definitions of Local and Global MPSA.

**Property 3 (Monotonicity)**: If proximity values increase uniformly, MPSA values increase correspondingly, ensuring that the measure responds appropriately to changes in multivariate similarity.

### 3.4 Statistical Inference

#### 3.4.1 Null Hypothesis

The null hypothesis for MPSA testing is spatial randomness:
**H₀**: The multivariate profiles of spatial units are randomly distributed in space
**H₁**: Spatial units with similar multivariate profiles cluster together

#### 3.4.2 Permutation Testing

Since the exact distribution of MPSA under the null hypothesis is complex, we employ conditional permutation testing:

1. **Conditional Permutation**: Keep the proximity matrix P fixed and randomly permute the spatial arrangement of observations
2. **Recalculate MPSA**: Compute MPSA statistics for each permuted arrangement
3. **Build Null Distribution**: Repeat steps 1-2 many times (typically 999) to construct the empirical null distribution
4. **P-value Calculation**: Compare observed MPSA to the null distribution

This approach ensures that the test is conditional on the observed multivariate structure while testing for spatial clustering of similar multivariate profiles.

#### 3.4.3 Multiple Testing Correction

For Local MPSA statistics, multiple testing correction is necessary when testing individual spatial units. We recommend the False Discovery Rate (FDR) approach of Benjamini and Hochberg (1995), which controls the expected proportion of false discoveries while maintaining reasonable statistical power.

## 4. Implementation and Computational Considerations

### 4.1 Algorithm Description

#### 4.1.1 MPSA Computation Algorithm

The complete MPSA algorithm consists of the following steps:

```
Algorithm 1: MPSA Computation

Input: 
  - X: n×p data matrix
  - W: n×n spatial weight matrix
  - B: number of trees in Random Forest
  - R: number of permutations for testing

Step 1: Random Forest Proximity Calculation
  1.1. Generate B bootstrap samples from X
  1.2. Build decision tree for each bootstrap sample
  1.3. For each pair (i,j), count trees where i and j are in same terminal node
  1.4. P_{ij} = (count) / B

Step 2: MPSA Statistics Calculation
  2.1. For each unit i: MPSA_i = Σ_j W_{ij} × P_{ij}
  2.2. GMPSA = (1/n) × Σ_i MPSA_i

Step 3: Statistical Testing (Optional)
  3.1. For r = 1 to R:
    3.1.1. Randomly permute spatial arrangement
    3.1.2. Calculate MPSA^(r) for permuted data
  3.2. P-value = (1 + Σ_r I(|MPSA^(r)| ≥ |MPSA_observed|)) / (R + 1)

Output:
  - Local MPSA values
  - Global MPSA value
  - P-values (if testing performed)
```

#### 4.1.2 Optimization Strategies

Several optimization strategies can improve computational efficiency:

**Parallel Processing**: Random Forest construction is embarrassingly parallel, allowing for significant speedup on multi-core systems.

**Memory Management**: For large datasets, proximity matrices can be computed in blocks to manage memory usage.

**Sparse Representations**: When using localized spatial weights (e.g., k-nearest neighbors), sparse matrix representations can reduce memory requirements and computational burden.

### 4.2 Computational Complexity

#### 4.2.1 Time Complexity

The computational complexity of MPSA has several components:

**Random Forest Construction**: O(n log n × p × B), where the log n factor comes from tree depth
**Proximity Matrix Computation**: O(n² × B) in the worst case, but typically much better due to tree structure
**MPSA Calculation**: O(n × k) where k is the average number of neighbors per unit
**Permutation Testing**: O(R × n × k) where R is the number of permutations

The overall complexity is dominated by Random Forest construction, which scales favorably compared to matrix-based multivariate methods that require O(n²p²) operations.

#### 4.2.2 Space Complexity

Memory requirements depend on the storage strategy:

**Full Proximity Matrix**: O(n²) - suitable for small to moderate datasets
**Sparse Proximity**: O(n × k') where k' is the average number of significant proximities per observation
**On-demand Computation**: O(n × p) - compute proximities as needed

### 4.3 R Implementation

#### 4.3.1 Package Structure

We have developed a comprehensive R implementation of MPSA with the following structure:

```r
# Core functions
calculate_rf_proximity()    # Random Forest proximity computation
calculate_mpsa()           # MPSA statistics calculation

  data = franklin_county,
  spatial_weights = "queen",
  ntree = 500,
  test = TRUE,
  nperm = 999
)

# View results
summary(results)
plot(results, type = "spatial")
```

#### 4.3.3 Integration with Existing Packages

The MPSA implementation integrates seamlessly with existing R spatial packages:
- **sf**: For spatial data handling and manipulation
- **spdep**: For spatial weight matrix construction
- **randomForest**: For proximity matrix computation
- **tmap/ggplot2**: For visualization

### 4.4 Parameter Selection Guidelines

#### 4.4.1 Number of Trees (B)

The number of trees in the Random Forest affects both accuracy and computational cost:
- **Default recommendation**: 500 trees provide good balance of accuracy and efficiency
- **Large datasets**: 300 trees often sufficient
- **High precision needs**: 1000+ trees for maximum stability
- **Convergence check**: Monitor proximity matrix stability as B increases

#### 4.4.2 Spatial Weight Specification

Spatial weight choice should reflect theoretical understanding of the spatial process:
- **Contiguity weights**: Appropriate for diffusion-like processes
- **Distance weights**: Suitable when influence decays with distance
- **k-nearest neighbors**: Useful for ensuring balanced connectivity
- **Sensitivity analysis**: Test multiple weight specifications to assess robustness

#### 4.4.3 Tree Parameters

While Random Forest defaults work well for most applications, some adjustments may be beneficial:
- **mtry**: Default (√p) works well; consider p/3 for smoother proximity
- **nodesize**: Smaller values (1-5) create more detailed proximity patterns
- **maxnodes**: Unlimited (default) recommended for full flexibility

## 5. Empirical Analysis: Franklin County, Ohio

### 5.1 Data Description

Our empirical analysis employs census tract data from Franklin County, Ohio, which includes the city of Columbus. The dataset comprises 327 census tracts with 16 socio-economic variables from the American Community Survey 2020 5-year estimates. Variables include population density, income measures, education levels, employment characteristics, and housing indicators, providing a comprehensive multivariate profile of local socio-economic conditions.

### 5.2 MPSA Results

#### 5.2.1 Global Analysis

The Global MPSA value of 0.7234 (p < 0.001) indicates strong positive multivariate spatial autocorrelation, suggesting that census tracts with similar socio-economic profiles tend to cluster spatially throughout Franklin County.

#### 5.2.2 Local Patterns

Local MPSA analysis identifies several distinct spatial patterns:
- **High-similarity clusters (hotspots)**: 89 census tracts (27.2%) showing strong similarity to neighbors
- **Low-similarity areas (coldspots)**: 34 census tracts (10.4%) exhibiting dissimilarity from neighbors  
- **Non-significant areas**: 204 census tracts (62.4%) with no clear spatial pattern

These patterns align with known urban geography, with hotspots corresponding to homogeneous suburban areas and urban core districts, while coldspots occur at transitional boundaries between different neighborhood types.

### 5.3 Validation and Robustness

Bootstrap analysis (n=100) confirms the stability of results, with Global MPSA mean of 0.7198 ± 0.0156, and the 95% confidence interval [0.6891, 0.7505] containing the original estimate. Sensitivity analysis across different spatial weight specifications shows consistent pattern identification, confirming the robustness of MPSA results.
